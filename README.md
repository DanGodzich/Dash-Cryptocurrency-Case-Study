The lead investor during the initial coin offering
was the venture capital firm **All Blue Capital** based in New York City.
**Plutus21**, a venture capital firm out of Dallas, Texas, was the second investor during the initial coin offerring. 

Dash, like other Cryptocurrecies based on blockchain technology,
is decentralized and is not managed by a central organization.
Dash does have Dash Core Group Inc., an organization
that works for the network and is the main developer. 
Dash Core Group, upon approval of the network, is funded directly from the Dash blockchain.

The competitors for Dash are the major Cyptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Cardano. Dash is attempting otflank these larger cryptocurrencies by offering faster transaction times and a friendlier user experience.

## Technology

Dash is not based upon the "Proof of Work" concept used by such crptocurencies as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Proof of Work means that a majority of miners have to approve a transaction. The miners are then rewarded with a postion of coin for their work. As the crypto networks grow larger this slows down tranaction speeds.

Dash is based upon "Proof of Stake" technology. While Dash does have miners, transactions are approved by a two-thirds majority of "Masternodes." Masternodes are servers that hold 1000 Dash as collateral and perfom services for the network. (The collateral, or "stake" is where the Proof of Stake name comes from.)

The Masternodes are rewarded for their services with regular payments. Masternodes also having voting rights to help decide how 10% of block reward funds are awarded each month. Those awards are used to fund community projects supporting the Dash network. 

The principle developer of the Dash ecosystem is the Dash Core Group (DCG), Inc, a Scottsdale, AZ company. The CEO of Dash Core Group is Ryan Taylor. Taylor previously worked as an advisor to private equity and hedge funds in New York City. Prior to that Taylor was an Associate Principle at McKinsey and Company.

DCG has released Dash Platform v0.17 to testnet. This is a test of what is to be a release of DashPay down the road. DashPay will be a platform on both Android and IOS designed to compete with more centralized services such as Venmo, Sqaure, Apple Pay and even credit cards. 

Dash's Masternode technology allows transactions to process in less than one second, much faster than the ten minutes rquired by Bitcoin, for example. That will be attractive to individuals. Dash is also able to process the transaction for much smaller fees than the centralized services mantioned above. That will be attractive to merchants. The DashPay App, once released, will place this ability in the hands of everyday individuals and businesses in a simple format that is easy to use. 

Dash has over 155,000 merchants that accept the Dash currency as payment. In Latin America, fast food vendors such as Church's Chicken and Burger King already accept Dash for payment.
