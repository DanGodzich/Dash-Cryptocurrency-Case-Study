Dash Cyptocurrency was launched in January of 2014. 
It was founded by Evan Duffield. It is based on Bitcoin, the world's 
first crypotcurrency, and can be considered a fork
of Bitcoin.

The lead investor during the initial coin offering
was the venture capital firm [**All Blue Capital**](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/all-blue-capital) based in New York City.
[**Plutus21**](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/plutus21), a venture capital firm out of Dallas, Texas, was the second investor during the initial coin offerring. 

Dash, like other Cryptocurrecies based on blockchain technology,
is decentralized and is not managed by a central organization.
Dash does have Dash Core Group Inc., an organization
that works for the network and is the main developer. 
Dash Core Group, upon approval of the network, is funded directly from the Dash blockchain.

The competitors for Dash are the [major](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/most-important-cryptocurrencies-other-than-bitcoin/)
 Cyptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Cardano. Dash is attempting otflank these larger cryptocurrencies by offering faster transaction times and a friendlier user experience.

## Technology

Dash is not based upon the "Proof of Work" concept used by such crptocurencies as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Proof of Work means that a majority of miners have to approve a transaction. The miners are then rewarded with a postion of coin for their work. As the crypto networks grow larger this slows down tranaction speeds.

Dash is based upon "Proof of Stake" technology. While Dash does have miners, transactions are approved by a two-thirds majority of "Masternodes." [Masternodes](https://www.dash.org/masternodes/#:~:text=Masternodes%20are%20powerful%20servers%20backed,and%20governance%20on%20the%20blockchain.&text=Masternodes%20must%20be%20backed%20by,they%20provide%20to%20the%20network) are servers that hold 1000 Dash as collateral and perfom services for the network. (The collateral, or "stake" is where the Proof of Stake name comes from.)

The Masternodes are rewarded for their services with regular payments. Masternodes also having voting rights to help decide how 10% of block reward funds are awarded each month. Those awards are used to fund community projects supporting the Dash network. 

The principle developer of the Dash ecosystem is the Dash Core Group (DCG), Inc, a Scottsdale, AZ company. The CEO of Dash Core Group is [Ryan Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-taylor-dash/). Taylor previously worked as an advisor to private equity and hedge funds in New York City. Prior to that Taylor was an Associate Principle at McKinsey and Company.

DCG has released Dash Platform v0.17 to testnet. This is a test of what is to be a release of DashPay down the road. DashPay will be a platform on both Android and IOS designed to compete with more centralized services such as Venmo, Sqaure, Apple Pay and even credit cards. 

Dash's Masternode technology allows transactions to process in less than one second, much faster than the ten minutes rquired by Bitcoin, for example. That will be attractive to individuals. Dash is also able to process the transaction for much smaller fees than the centralized services mantioned above. That will be attractive to merchants. The DashPay App, once released, will place this ability in the hands of everyday individuals and businesses in a simple format that is easy to use. 

Dash has over 155,000 merchants that accept the Dash currency as payment. In Latin America, fast food vendors such as Church's Chicken and Burger King already accept Dash for payment. 

## Challenges With Regulators

On December 18, 2020, the U.S, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued new proposed rules regarding crypto currencies. FinCEN is a division of the US Department of the Treasury that was formed in 1990 as part of the Bank Secrecy Act, a measure to combat money laundering by terrorist and criminal organizations. 

In that proposed rule, FinCEN proposed cryptocurrency exchanges would have to keep records of Crypto Wallet transaction above $3000. For amounts of $10,000 or more the exchanges would have to report the transaction to FinCEN.

Most of the crypto currency domain is pushing back on the proposed rule change as unworkable. But that is not the main problem coming from FinCEN for Dash. 

As part of the proposed rule change, FinCEN had a section addressing what they called Anonymity Enhanced Crptocurrencies (AEC). They gave as examples the Crptocurrencies, monero, zcash and Dash.

Two weeks later, the crypto currency exchange [Bittrex](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/http://www.cryptalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DASHLOGO.png) announced they would be delisting monero, zcash and Dash from their exchange. While no reason was given, it seems to be a reaction to the FinCEN referencing of them as AECs or "privacy coins."

Dash promptly issued press releases and and tweets disputing the claim. Dash contends that it's PrivateSend utility is no different than similar utilities used by Bitcoin and Litecoin, which are not considered AECs. 

At the time of this writing, Dash is trying to plead their case and be relisted on Bittrex. 

## Outlook

Despite being delisted by Bittrex, Dash has seen the value of the currency increase in recent months. This is appears to be in response to Dash Core Group releasing the early version of DashPay to testnet. 

If Dash is able to succesfully make the case that it is not a privacy coin, and continue to attract participating merchants to the network, the sky is the limit. Dash could become a break out Cryptocurrency which is accepted and used by the general public.  Dash has the potential to become a competitor not just to the major cryptocurrencies, but to widespread  centralized financial payment and fund transfer services. 

## Recomendation

Dash appears to be suffering from a perception problem that comes from the early days of the cyrptocurrency. When founded, Dash was intiially call X Coin. Then, briefly it was called "Darkcoin."

That was a true marketing mistake. Darkcoin sounds like something Darth Vader or Thanos would have in their wallet. 

The eventual goal of Dash appears to be a competitor of Venmo, Square, and even Mastercard and Visa. The latter three use traditional advertising, including paid TV and Radio aspots to help promote their financial service product.

The name was changed to Dash, which in a [video](https://www.dash.org/2021/02/03/ensuring-regulatory/) Dash Core Group CEO explains was a "portmanteau"of Digital and Cash.

"Portmanteau" is word that is accesible to members of the cryptogaphy and tech world. It is not a term that would be easily understood by the general public. 

Dash should start now with a slight rebranding that will be able to bridge the transition from cryptocurrency to every day service. It needs to be something that can eventually be workable with a mass media roll out. Staying consistent is important.

It could look something like this:

>*DASH*

>*The Digital cASH*

>*Fast. Friendy. Secure.*

Of course this would be designed by professional graphic artists and then focused grouped for both the general public and the current Dash network. It is important to not lose your current base of support while reaching out to new users.

## Conclusion

Dash needs to rectify the current regulatory concerns, which they are already working on. They are also working on the roll out of the DashPay platform. If DashPay is succesful and they are able to convince many more merchants to come on board, the future of Dash is very bright.
